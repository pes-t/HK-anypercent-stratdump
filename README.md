## Introduction
This is a collection of various strats for the Hollow Knight any% nmg run. I will attempt to keep this as up to date as possible with the fastest strats for various rooms, but this will not be a room-by-room guide for the route. If you are looking for a guide that just to learn the run or outline the general route, not optimize the strats, please check out the guide located [here](https://www.speedrun.com/hollowknight/guide/j234z). If you are looking for a guide for Current Patch any% nmg, please check out the guide located [here](https://www.speedrun.com/hollowknight/guide/gq0g3). For specific questions, please join the [Hollow Knight Discord](https://discord.com/invite/hollowknight) and ask in the #speedrunning channel. 

If you have any suggestions about strats to be added to this doc, please DM me on discord at Pestilentbox2#1239
## General Movement
It is faster to Crystal Dash if you are traveling over a horizontal distance of more than 4 dashes (with no dashmaster equipped). If you are moving through a screen transition, it is faster to Crystal Dash if the total distance is more than 2 dashes.
## Formatting
This guide will be split up into different markdown files to avoid needing to load 50+ gifs at a time when checking this guide. Each chapter will cover an individual section of the run, and will have a table of contents attempting to segment the splits into multiple parts
## Credits
Huge thanks for koralreef and buhbai for their github guides in celeste that inspired me to make this guide. Huge thanks to everyone who have contributed to the creation and documentation of these strats
