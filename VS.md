   Basic softfall setup

   \
   Most basic version of the softfall setup. Jump right as the floor crumbles and breaks apart, then land on the upper part of the platform.

   \
   Slightly more involved version of the softfall setup. Jump right as the floor crumbles and breaks apart, but cancel your upwards momentum with an upswing right as you leave the ground. You should barely need to stop holding right at all. If you find yourself still needing to go neutral, your nail swing is too late. Saves .05-.1 over the non-upswing version of the strat.

   Rng softfall

   \
   Fastest way to do the room, but also rng as to when it happens with no tells as to when it will work. Saves 0.3 over the non-upswing version of the strat.

   This trick is decently tight. You want to jump from your starting location once you see the aspids begin to spawn in, then buffer a jump and hit the spike before it starts to fall. If done correctly, the spike will kill both aspids instantly. 
   
   Due to the positions of the platforms, using the bottom platform is slightly faster (due to you standing closer to the spike) but imo is a bit harder than doing the top platform version. Try both versions out and pick which once you like the best.

   Do a full jump at the red line to land on the middle ledge. Jump over the first goam (not quite a full jump) and you should be set up to make the rest of the cycle.

   This strat involves manipulating the position of a fly so it doesn't kill itself on a goam and cause the game to lag. Do a full jump over the first goam and as high a jump as possible (without bonking on the wall) over the 2nd goam. Saves ~0.1s

   The bottleneck for statue pogo is moreso in the vertical position of the knight, and less about the horizontal position. Once you clear the platform, you'll need to pause for a bit to let the knight get high enough to land on the platform.

  Pre-jumping while breaking the FK shortcut allows you to start moving towards the main drop a bit sooner than not jumping.
