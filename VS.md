   Non-upswing softfall setup

   \
  Most basic version of the softfall setup. Jump right as the floor crumbles and breaks apart, then land on the upper part of the platform.

   Upswing softfall setup

   \
   Slightly more involved version of the softfall setup. Jump right as the floor crumbles and breaks apart, but cancel your upwards momentum with an upswing right as you leave the ground. You should barely need to stop holding right at all. If you find yourself still needing to go neutral, your nail swing is too late. Saves .05-.1 over the non-upswing version of the strat. 


   Rng softfall

   \
   Fastest way to do the room, but also rng as to when it happens with no tells as to when it will work. Saves 0.3 over the non-upswing version of the strat.
