   Basic softfall setup

   \
   Most basic version of the softfall setup. Jump right as the floor crumbles and breaks apart, then land on the upper part of the platform.

   \
   Slightly more involved version of the softfall setup. Jump right as the floor crumbles and breaks apart, but cancel your upwards momentum with an upswing right as you leave the ground. You should barely need to stop holding right at all. If you find yourself still needing to go neutral, your nail swing is too late. Saves .05-.1 over the non-upswing version of the strat.

<details><summary>Rng softfall</summary>
   Rng softfall

   \
   Fastest way to do the room, but also rng as to when it happens with no tells as to when it will work. Saves 0.3 over the non-upswing version of the strat.

   Do a full jump at the red line to land on the middle ledge. Jump over the first goam (not quite a full jump) and you should be setup to make the rest of the cycle.

   This strat involves manipulating the position of a fly so it doesn't kill itself on a goam and cause the game to lag. Do a full jump over the first goam and as high a jump as possible (without bonking on the wall) over the 2nd goam.

   The bottleneck for statue pogo is moreso in the vertical position of the knight, and less about the horizontal position. Once you clear the platform, you'll need to pause for a bit to let the knight get high enough to land on the platform. 
   
   The tiktik pogo is included for completeness, but doesn't save time over a well executed statue pogo. It is also way harder, but it looks kinda cool so be warned.

  Pre-jumping while breaking the FK shortcut allows you to start moving towards the main drop a bit sooner than not jumping.
